<p><strong>1.Background:</strong></p>
<p>This homework was created in order to help the students practise creating html file (website) that includes background;  method with some codes; results with some graphs and mathematical notations; and conclusion.</p>
<p>For enhancing the aesthetics of my .html file , I uploaded different files in the github work repository as:</p>
<p>This is my <a href="https://github.com/seemazzz/hw4_intermediate_webdesign/blob/main/stmarkdown.css">stmarkdown.css</a> file</p>

<p><strong>2.Methods:</strong></p>
<p>First, a variable &ldquo;age&rdquo; was created, once with a normal distribution of ages, and second with the t-distribition of ages, using a simulated data. Then, in a single figure (<u>overlay histogram</u>), those distributions were plotted together to show how different the distributions look visually.</p>
<p><strong>Codes for generating simulated data, creating variables and making graphs</strong></p>
<pre><code>.     **Clear all
.         cls

.         clear all

.     ** Set working Directory
.         * See present working directory
.         pwd 

. 
.         * Specify to use the present working directory, and specify separately for Window
&gt; s and Mac
.         if c(os)==&quot;Windows&quot; { //method for window

.         else { // method for mac

.     **Data Simulation:Initialize your dataset with 30 observations
.         set seed 521774

.         set obs 30

. 
.     **Variable Generation
.         *Create an age variable with a mean of 57 years and a standard deviation of 15. 
.         *Use the command (to simulate a normal distribution)
.         capture drop age

.         gen age = (rnormal() * 15) + 57

.     
.         *Alternatively, simulate a t-distribution.
.         capture drop age_t

.         gen age_t=(rt(_N)*15)+57

.         
.     ** Graphical Representation
.         *Plot a histogram of the age variables from both rnormal() and rt(), and overlay 
&gt; it with a theoretical normal distribution curve. 
.         *This visualization will help in understanding the distribution of age among the 
&gt; observations.

<p>The results in this analysis are based on simulated data. There are 30 number of observations and 2 variables in the simulated dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:Graph showing different distribution of ages</strong></p>
<p><img src="Graph.svg" ></p>
<p><em>$\text{Age(years) in Normal Distribution} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=57.14364,,\sigma=16.45974)$</em> <em>$\text{Age(years) in T-distribution} \sim \mathcal{t}(\mu=56.533884,,\sigma=15.009746)$</em></p>
<p><strong>4.Conclusion:</strong> The histogram clearly shows that though the two distributions had similar mean and SD of age, they have different shapes and tail behaviour. While the normal distribution yields a bell-shaped curve, the t-distribution exhibits slightly heavier tail, which indicates that there is a greater likelihood of extreme age values. It shows the importance of understanding the shape of distribution of variables before implementing further statistical analysis.</p>
